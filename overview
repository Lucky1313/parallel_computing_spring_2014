Genetic Algorithm

Fitness Function:
Parameters:
Distance between connected terminals - minimize
Number of turns/angles in wire - minimize
Distance between inputs and left side - minimize
Distance between outputs and right side - minimize
Distance between power and upper side - minimize
Distance between ground and lower side - minimize

Heuristic Improvements:
Aligning transistors
Perserving gates
Minimum distance between transistors

Mutations:
Moving transistors

How to combine layouts?
Parents with high fitness function score combine. Areas of layout with high scores are kept?


Constraints:
Minimum distance between terminals
Transistor terminals must be aligned properly


Implementation:
Blocks - Islands
Threads - Individuals

Individuals only interact with others on same island (block). Shared memory should be used. Maybe include
migration from Island to Island?

Genetic Algorithm Order:
Parents
Evaluation - Determining best individuals based on fitness function
Selectrion - Order individuals and select best ones
Crossover - Create new individuals from parents
Mutation - Create new individuals by changing single individuals
Offspring become parents
